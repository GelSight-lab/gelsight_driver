## Usage:

### 1. Create a folder (e.g. cali_180110) containing: 
	frame0.jpg 
	Im\_\*.jpg 

The frame0 is the blank GelSight image without any touch. The Im_*.jpg is the GelSight image with a ball pressing on it. This is to build up the lookup table from RGB to gradients. More images on different areas will make the lookup table more precise.

### 2. Calculate the Pixmm parameter, which represents how much millimeters one pixel is corresponding to. 

Use a caliper to press multiple times on the GelSight and counting the corresponding pixels in GelSight images. After calculation, it should be placed in calibration.m.

### 3. Run the calibration.m to select circle ranges.

It will pop out interactive window to select the circle to cover the ball. Itâ€™s already calculated by program. The user should use keyboard input to make it more precise. 

### Keyboard command: 

* +/- keys: enlarge/shrink the circle
* up/down/left/right arrow keys: move the circle
* ESC: next image.
