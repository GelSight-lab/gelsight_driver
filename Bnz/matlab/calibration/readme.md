## Usage

### 1. Create a folder (e.g. cali_180110) containing: 
	frame0.jpg 
	Im_*.jpg 

The frame0 is the blank GelSight image without any touch. The Im_*.jpg is the GelSight image with a ball pressing on it. This is to build up the lookup table from RGB to gradients. About 10 images on different areas will usually be sufficient.

### 2. Calculate the Pixmm parameter, which represents how much millimeters one pixel is corresponding to. 

Use a caliper to press multiple times on the GelSight and counting the corresponding pixels in GelSight images. After calculation, update the `Pixmm` in calibration.m, eg.

	Pixmm=0.03026

### 3. Run the calibration.m to select circle ranges.

It will pop out interactive window to select the circle to cover the ball. Itâ€™s already calculated by program. The user should use keyboard input to make it more precise. 

Keyboard command: 

	* +/-: enlarge/shrink the circle
	* up/down/left/right: move the circle
	* ESC: next image
